-- SEPIA LATIMANUS --

Kraken <http://www.assembla.com/spaces/kraken-lua/wiki> should be a
great project, but fails at a critical detail: itâ€™s too big!

Kraken aims to solve to many problems, instead of solving the current
one.

A lighter project could be a more elegant approach. So a lighter
cephalopod is Sepia latimanus
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadclub_Cuttlefish>.

So Sepia can be that light, it requires some dependencies:

- Kodumaro Lua <https://gitorious.org/kodumaro-lua>

	Project that provides some useful features to Lua environment, like:

	- base64
	- bignum
	- sss (Simple Stupid Socket)
	- uuid

	Simple Stupid Socket is a lighter approach to Kraken Socket,
	<http://www.assembla.com/spaces/kraken-socket/wiki>, that suffer the
	same mistakes of Kraken.

- lua51pthread <http://lua51pthread.luaforge.net/>

	Project created by Mildred, <mildred593@online.fr>, to provide Posix
	pthread features to Lua.
